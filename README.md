# Random Numbers Facts
This React application uses the Numbers API to generate random facts about numbers. I created this application to practice consuming API's with React.js.

I learned how to correctly make requests to the API as well as using syntax like async/await to handle promisses. 

I also hosted the [Random Numbers Facts website](http://random-numbers-facts.herokuapp.com/ "Try Me!") onto the heroku server. Feel free to check it out and play around with the website I created.
